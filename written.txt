1a. start codon(ATG) = 111821 times; 
    stop codon (TAA) = 8458 times; (TAG) = 30102; (TGA) = 115364

1b. No, we cannot infer the number of open reading frames based on the frequency 
of start and stop codons alone. To identify the open reading frames, the entire
sequence in question will have to be analyzed more in depth.


2. searching exactly one pattern that is one charcter long results in similar running times.

3. Number of patterns to be searched results in having longer brute force 
running times since for each pattern, the whole sequence will have to be checked
while the aho corasick's running time is not affected much since it is based on the 
construction of a prefix trie
